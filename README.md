# genetic_swap
Swap algorithm in MIPS (Assembly language)

For this to work, you'll need either a platform which can run MIPS, or you could download the Java-based simulator "MARS"
and run it there. This was a project which is designed to teach how assembly works with low level instructions. I also call it
a "high-level programming language appreciation project". After you've done this once, you probably won't want to write in
assembly again. Although it was very enlightening. I am glad I did it.

I initially wrote everything in raw MIPS and then when I noticed some reusable code I added some macros which make the code a lot more readable (which you can see toward the top of the file).

You can also check out, build and compile the MIPS simulator via [MIPS Source Code](https://github.com/amnolan/mars). Or get the jar here
[MIPS Simulator Download](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/index.htm "MIPS Simulator Download")

How to run:

    Navigate to the Mars exe file
    ./mars # program starts up

From inside the app, go to file, find the file
